The Lightweight Threads Library (LWT) is part of (but entirely independent of) the ParaSail library.

I git cloned parasail and then I copied the lwt directory to here.
I also added build.sh and build.gpr to ./lwt/examples. This allows
the examples to be compiled by simply running build.sh (in lwt/examples).
