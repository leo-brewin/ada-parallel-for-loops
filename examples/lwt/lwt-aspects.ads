--  Prototype implementation of LWT.Aspects package

package LWT.Aspects is
   --  This supports a generalized aspect.

   type Root_Aspect is tagged limited null record;
      --  This type is used to define aspects that can be passed through
      --  to the underlying LWT scheduler.  Various operations given in
      --  LWT.Parallelism and LWT.Scheduler allow "access Root_Aspect'Class"
      --  as a parameter.
      --  Components of a record extension of this type may be specified
      --  in the optional aspect specification attached to a
      --  chunk specification of a parallel construct.
      --  Those without default values are mandatory; those with defaults
      --  need not be specified.  Only named notation may be used, but
      --  Boolean components can be specified just by their name, which
      --  is equivalent to "Bool_Component => True", as in a normal
      --  aspect specification.

end LWT.Aspects;
