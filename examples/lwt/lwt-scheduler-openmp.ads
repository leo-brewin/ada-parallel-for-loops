package LWT.Scheduler.OpenMP is
   --  This package implements a plug-in LWT scheduler for OpenMP.

   --  These two routines keep track of the number of active OpenMP
   --  parallel regions.  While there is at least one active, we establish
   --  OpenMP as the LWT scheduler.  These are called as a side-effect
   --  of initializing/finalizing an Interfaces.OpenMP.OMP_Parallel object.
   --  It is implementation-defined whether there is one LWT scheduler
   --  plug-in per Ada task, or one per program partition.
   procedure Incr_OpenMP_Parallel_Regions;
   procedure Decr_OpenMP_Parallel_Regions;

   procedure Set_Ada_Task_Identity
     (Identity : Ada.Task_Identification.Task_Id);
   --  Set the Ada task identity to be associated with the current LWT server

end LWT.Scheduler.OpenMP;
