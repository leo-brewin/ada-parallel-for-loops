   --  This generic package supports a parallel procedural iterator
   --  that calls a loop body multiple times, potentially in parallel
   --  (limited to Num_Chunks logical threads running in parallel at a time)
   --  providing a work item which the loop body can process and possibly
   --  generate new work items, which can be added onto the work list.
   --  The Max_Chunks parameter to the Loop_Body indicates
   --  the maximum number of threads that the Loop_Body should itself
   --  spawn, to avoid creating too many logical threads.
