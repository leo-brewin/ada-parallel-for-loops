ex1 : Uses rendezvous calls for multitaksing. Tasks created within procedure calls. Tasks are transient.
ex2 : As per ex1 but tasks exist for the duration of the program. Tasks are presistent.
ex3 : As per ex2 with small changes to use Ada.Synchronous_Barriers. Tasks are presistent.
ex4 : Uses proteced objects for multitasking. Tasks are presistent.

There are two version of each example code.
Version a: Includes put_line's to show the sequence of procedure/object/rendezvous calls.
Version b: No put_line's. Useful for timing. Also makes the code structure more readable with less clutter.
